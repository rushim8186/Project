Blood Request Management: Enable healthcare institutions to place blood requests, specifying the required blood type, quantity, and urgency.
Donor Eligibility Verification: Implement eligibility checks to ensure donors meet the necessary criteria for blood donation.
Appointment Scheduling: Facilitate the scheduling of donor appointments for blood donation.
Notifications: Send automated notifications to donors regarding upcoming appointments, blood request status, and blood shortage alerts.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports on blood inventory, donor statistics, blood request fulfillment, and other key metrics for analysis and decision-making.
